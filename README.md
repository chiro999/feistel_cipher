# Feistel Cipher

### Feistel cipher is a design model that derives different symmetric block ciphers, such as DES and Blowfish. It uses the same key for the encryption and decryption process. 
### Feistel cipher structure encrypts plain text in several rounds, where it applies substitution and permutation to the data. Each round uses a different key for encryption, and that same key is used for the decryption process.
